# Final Project Template Repository

This is the Template Repository for all of your problems sets.

The repository should contain at least 4 folders:

- `documents`: contains your final documents in `pdf` format. Ideally, figures and tables are pulled directly from the `views` folder. I've included a latex template I created last semester for the Thesis Seminar. You can use my lecture slides template for your slides if you want.
- `scripts`: contains all your scripts.
- `stores`: contains all the data sets used or a link to them.
- `views`: contains all figures and tables.



## Some considerations: 

- **Name your final documents attaching the folder's name to the exact name of the repository, separated by an underscore. Please place them in the corresponding folder.**. For example your {\it project proposal} will be in the folder "Documents/1_Proposal/1_Proposal-name-of-repo.pdf"
- Please follow the Final Project Guidelines for each stage of the final project.
- In your code, be sure to be clear, separating and commenting on each section.  Coding, like in writing, style is critical for readability.  If the code is well written, it should be self-contained. There is no need to write everything you did.  I encourage you to follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
- Do not include  code in your document. If you want, you can have a link to your repository.
